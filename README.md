# Fusion-local-files
This is for Users who do not want to use the cloud and only work with local files.
This plugin Adds an Open and a (Quick)save Button for local files in the Menu Bar of Fusion 360.

Local File Locations and names of the files are stored in a cache and used for saving.

To install it, in Fusion go to "Add-Ins" -> "Scripts and Add-Ins" -> Modules -> hit the green + next to "my modules" and select the downloaded folder. In the list the script is called "Save". Select it, then select "Run on startup" and press "execute" on the green arrow or restart Fusion.
